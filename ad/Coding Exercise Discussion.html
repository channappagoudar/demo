* Describe a fault tolerant deployment topology for your application, and the types of failures it would and would not be resilient to.

A fault tolerant deployment topology would involve either verical or horizontal scaling or a combination of both

Multiple nodes can be fronted by a load balancer

I used a ArrayList, it is only persisted until next JVM restart.
Had a DB been used, the objects could be persisted despite JVM restart
